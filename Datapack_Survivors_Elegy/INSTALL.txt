How to install:
1. Unzip the file this document is in.
2. Put Datapack_Survivors_Elegy_[···].zip in your world. This can be done on the world creation tab, dragging the file in the DataPacks window.
3. Find the resourcepack. In CurseForge, it has been downloaded in the same zip file as the datapack. In Modrinth, you must scroll down on the version page to "Files", where it must be downloaded separately.
4. Drag Texturepack_Survivors_Elegy_[···].zip in your resourcepack folder and select it in the Resource Packs window.

You're ready to go!
