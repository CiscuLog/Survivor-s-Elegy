# Survivor-s-Elegy
Survivor's Elegy is a Minecraft Java datapack which adds a multitude of features to enhance the vanilla gameplay.

The objective of the datapack is to create a refreshed game experience, mantaining the core vanilla mechanics and adding a spin to them, recontextualising and building a breathing world around it.
