Simply removing Survivor's Elegy will cause problems to your world, making it unable to load. This is because of the custom biomes added by the datapack. The game needs to know what those biomes are, otherwise it will not be able to load the dimension.
To solve that issue, follow the steps:

How to uninstall:
1. Remove the "DataPack_Survivors_Elegy_alpha_v0.x.x.zip" datapack from your world.
2. Add the "Uninstall_Survivors_Elegy.zip" file in your world

You're ready to go!
The biomes added by Survivor's Elegy will remain in the world, and all other custom items will return to their natural vanilla behavior
